Description: This program creates a simulation of circles that drop under
             the influence of gravity and whenever one circle hits another,
             the bigger one swallows up the smaller one. It imports
             three_shapes_game.py and the random module.

class Circle:
    '''
    This class creates the circle objects for the simulation. Circles
    follow gravity and get slower as they bounce. They also take in the
    smaller circles.

    The constructor initializes the x and y positions of the center of the
    circles, the radius, and the speed at which they're going to move, which
    is selected at random from a particular range

    get_xy(): This method gets the x and y positions of the circle in the
              form of a tuple
    get_radius(): This method gets the radius of the circle
    nearby(): This method determines whether or not there is another circle
              close to the circle the code is looking at
    edge(): This method describes what's going to happen to the circle when
            it gets close to an edge of the canvas
    move(): This method moves the shape itself
    draw(): This method draws out the circles and randomizes their color
