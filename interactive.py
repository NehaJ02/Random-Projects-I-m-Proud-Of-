"""Main program for Battleship

   Author: Russ Lewis

   Creates a board.  Right now, the code hard-codes the board in one of two
   arrangements: a standard one, using 5 standard ship types, and a "tetris"
   one, where the board (kind of) looks like a Tetris game in progress.

   After creating the board, enters a while loop, which runs until

    # Style hint: if you have an important variable which is not *currently*
    #             changing, but which you anticipate might change in the
    #             future, then do it in all caps to mark it as a "CONSTANT."
    #
    #             A constant *must never* change during a program run.
    #             However, it's quite reasonable (common even) for a
    #             programmer to change the constant - meaning that this
    #             error might go away.
